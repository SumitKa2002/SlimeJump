# SlimeJump

#Inspiration:
I was trying to make a game that doesn't have much complex controls so a single touch control felt like the way to go. I was initially gonna make a simple touch to jump game but saw this approach and decided to add this instead.

#Controls:
Drag the player to the direction you want the player to throw itself to. A line will appear to show your traversal path.

#Gameplay:
- Collect coins
- Collect key to unlock door
- Dodge traps and enemies
